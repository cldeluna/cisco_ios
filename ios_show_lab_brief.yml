# This playbook utilizes the ios_command ansible module to execute a set of
# show commands against the cisco ios devices defined in the [cisco_xe]
# group within the hosts file.   The command iterates over a list of show commands
# and saves the result of each command into the output variable.
#
# The output variable is then displayed as part of the playbook run
#
# The contents of the output variable are then saved using two different methods.
# device-output.txt has the raw output format which is a JSON data structure
# device.cfg saves the results of the first command sent which in this case
# is the show run command (hence the .cfg file type)
#
# The final play uses the templates module to save the show command output in the
# more traditional text based output.
#
# The resulting output files are saved in the ./logs directory
#
# This version only includes show commands that will likely work.
#
# EXECUTION:
# ansible-playbook -i hosts ios_show_lab_brief.yml
