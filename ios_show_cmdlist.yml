# This playbook utilizes the aireos_command ansible module to execute a set of
# show commands from a varialbe file in group_vars against the cisco wireless
# controllers defined in the [cisco_wlc] group within the hosts file.
# The command executes a list of show commands
# using with_items and saves the result of each command into the output variable.
# The show commands are in a list variable in group_vars/wlc_cmdlist.yml.  This
# facilitates changing out the show commands without having to edit the playbook
# itself and provides a more modular approach.
#
# The with_items construct results in a dictionary data structure that could be
# manipulated more precisely in follow on actions.  Rather then reference an
# element in a list by number, the exact data can be reference by a key in a
# dictionary.
#
# The with_items construc also renders the display a bit more descriptive.
#
# The output variable is then displayed as part of the playbook run only if
#
# The contents of the output variable are then saved using a Jinja filter that
# renders the output as "pretty" JSON
#
# EXECUTION:
# ansible-playbook -i hosts wlc_show_cmdlist.yml --ask-vault-pass
#
# To display the output variable run the playbook with a single v
# ansible-playbook -i hosts wlc_show_cmdlist.yml --ask-vault-pass -v
